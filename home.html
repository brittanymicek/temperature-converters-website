        <h3 class="display-6 font-weight-small">Fahrenheit</h3>
        <p>The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on one proposed in 1724 by
            the physicist Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit. It uses the degree Fahrenheit (symbol: °F) as the unit.
            Several accounts of how he originally defined his scale exist, but the original paper suggests the lower
            defining point, 0 °F, was established as the freezing temperature of a solution of brine made from a mixture
            of water, ice, and ammonium chloride (a salt). The other limit established was his best estimate of the
            average human body temperature, originally set at 90 °F, then 96 °F (about 2.6 °F less than the modern value
            due to a later redefinition of the scale). However, he noted a middle point of 32 °F, to be set to the
            temperature of ice water.

            The Fahrenheit scale is now usually defined by two fixed points: the temperature at which pure water ice
            melts is defined as 32 °F and the boiling point of water is defined to be 212 °F, both at sea level and
            under standard atmospheric pressure (a 180 °F separation).</p>

        <h3 class="display-6 font-weight-small">Celsius</h3>
        <p>The degree Celsius is a unit of temperature on the Celsius scale, a temperature scale originally known as the
            centigrade scale. The degree Celsius (symbol: °C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale
            or a unit to indicate a difference or range between two temperatures. It is named after the Swedish
            astronomer Anders Celsius, who developed a similar temperature scale. Before being renamed to
            honor Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and
            gradus, which means steps.

            Since 1743 the Celsius scale has been based on 0 °C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the
            boiling point of water at 1 atm pressure. Prior to 1743 the values were reversed (i.e. the boiling point was
            0 degrees and the freezing point was 100 degrees).

            By international agreement, between 1954 and 2019 the unit degree Celsius and the Celsius scale were defined
            by absolute zero and the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW), a precisely defined water
            standard.</p>

        <h3 class="display-6 font-weight-small">Kelvin</h3>
        <p>The kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI), having the unit symbol
            K. It is named after the Belfast-born Glasgow University engineer and physicist William Thomson, 1st Baron
            Kelvin (1824–1907).

            The kelvin is now defined by fixing the numerical value of the Boltzmann constant k to 1.380 649×10−23
            J⋅K−1. Hence, one kelvin is equal to a change in the thermodynamic temperature T that results in a change of
            thermal energy kT by 1.380 649×10−23 J.

            The Kelvin scale fulfills Thomson's requirements as an absolute thermodynamic temperature scale. It uses
            absolute zero as its null point (i.e. low entropy). The relation between kelvin and celsius scales is TK =
            t°C + 273.15. On the Kelvin scale, pure water freezes at 273.15 K, and it boils at 373.15 K.

            Unlike the degree Fahrenheit and degree Celsius, the kelvin is not referred to or written as a degree. The
            kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement for the physical sciences, but is often used in
            conjunction with the degree Celsius, which has the same magnitude.</p>
